                        <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                        <p>Gorillas are the largest non-human primates, reaching heights between 1.25-1.8 m, weights between 100–270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 meters, depending on species and sex. They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. The Eastern gorilla is distinguished from the Western by darker fur color and some other minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 35–40 years in the wild.</p>
                         <strong>WHERE CAN YOU FIND THEM?</strong>
                         <p>Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although their range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres (7,200 to 14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda.</p>
